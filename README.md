## Introduction

Rules to determine who has better cards:

 - J, Q, K are regarded as special cards.
 - Rule 1: The one with more special cards wins.
 - Rule 2: If both have the same number of special cards, add the face values of the other card(s) and take the remainder after dividing the sum by 10. The one with a bigger remainder wins. (Note: Ace = 1).
 - Rule 3: The dealer wins if both rule 1 and rule 2 cannot distinguish the winner.
